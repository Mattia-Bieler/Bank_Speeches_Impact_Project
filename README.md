# Bank Speeches Impact Project
__As part of a team, I was responsible for:__
* Analysing trends in the sentiment of bank speeches over time, utilising natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis.
* Investigating the correlation between the sentiment expressed in bank speeches and key events, as well as economic indicators, such as bank rate decisions, GDP growth, and inflation, employing statistical methods to discern meaningful relationships and patterns.
* Engaging in continuous learning and adaptation of analysis based on feedback and emerging trends, contributing to a dynamic and responsive analytical approach.
* Deriving actionable insights and findings from the analysis, offering valuable information on the impact of Bank communications on the economy and the potential predictive power of sentiment analysis.
* Collaborating with the team to document methodologies, data sources, and assumptions made during the analysis, ensuring transparency and replicability of the research.
* Leading the team through the culmination of our project, taking charge during the final week to deliver a compelling final presentation and finalise our comprehensive report.

### GitHub Repository
[__LINK TO PROJECT REPOSITORY__](https://github.com/Mattia-Bieler/Team_BoE_Seven.git)

I initiated and managed the GitHub repository, defining structure and ensuring clear documentation. This facilitated seamless collaboration, code sharing, and efficient project development.

### Jupyter Notebook (Python) (Appendix 1)
In collaboration with a team member, I conducted the analysis using Python. Our joint efforts resulted in the creation of two separate notebooks. Subsequently, I integrated the findings and code from both notebooks into a cohesive and comprehensive final analysis. The consolidated work is now available in the GitHub repository found above.

### Tableau Dashboard (Appendix 2)

I took the initiative to conceptualise, design, and implement a comprehensive Tableau dashboard that functioned as a dynamic visualisation tool for our team. The impetus behind the creation of this dashboard originated from my own decision-making process, driven by valuable stakeholder feedback received after our initial pitch.

### Report and Presentation

During the final week of the project, I assumed a leadership role within the team, taking charge of coordinating our collective efforts. I organised and led regular team meetings, fostering open communication and a collaborative environment. In these sessions, I actively monitored the progress of each team member, ensuring everyone remained updated on their tasks and responsibilities. This proactive approach streamlined our workflow, maintaining a high level of efficiency as we approached project completion.

In shaping the report and presentation, my focus was on providing crucial visualisations and insights derived from our analysis. Crafting the report, developing the PowerPoint presentation, and delivering the presentation were collaborative efforts led by other team members.
